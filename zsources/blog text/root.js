TITLE> i posted on osu!taiko's community forums about spinners preventing FCs
p> tl;dr: I posted about how spinners prevent a "Perfect" score on osu!taiko, even if you manage to full combo it, spinners make the game tell you that you did not FC.

check the post <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1163245">here</a> for more info

TITLE> let me present you: SCREEN DATA CAPTURE DESIGN
p> data capture is something really present to us, internet users, nowadays.

before internet, it was so hard to get info about everyone that used something you created, but nowadays is simple, you can store if someone clicked a button or something like that if you know a bit of social media marketing + web development or equivalent.

in the game osu! you have a pretty good example of this:

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/219948537754943489/766514897630003250/taiko_screen.png">

but let's simplify that:

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430201054173462548/766517343730794526/unknown.png">

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430201054173462548/766517904362438676/unknown.png">

here (in purple) we have the score section. there you can click to see more details about a score. clicking you go to this screen:

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430201054173462548/766521204194279434/unknown.png">

here you have the back button on the left and the watch button on the right. the design of the screens here is in a way that the user can't miss click the WATCH button to watch the replay without going from the left to the right of the screen.

that's something that mobile apps and webapps aren't doing at all, even though they want to get information about where the user is heading at towards the app usage path.

i think we should have a design that should be simple and intuitive, but at the same time, prevent miss clicks from the user so they can have a better experience with the app and so apps can track better their users.

TITLE> my solution for the FizzBuzz test
p> today i worked on a test mentioned in <a href="https://youtu.be/QPZ0pIK_wsc">this video

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QPZ0pIK_wsc/maxresdefault.jpg">
</a>

the first button shows what i have done in 2-3 minutes, and the other one shows a better version of it.

<a href="codes/FizzBuzz.html">here</a> you can see the result

what i noticed about my coding style is that i like to think ahead into the future. i was asking myself if i should simplify the code a little more and i was worried about someone trying to understand my code and if to change something was easy to do. that's why i tried to make a code fast and after that works i tried to make it better.

at the same time, you can see with the first try that i did not output exactly what was proposed. i output "3" instead of "Fizz", "5" instead of "Buzz" and "3 e 5" instead of "FizzBuzz". that's something i could work on from now on.

TITLE> rework de dificuldade do taiko
p>
ganhei 150pp enquanto muita gente perdeu muito mais

antes:

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430201054173462548/759900472177328128/unknown.png">

olha como surgiram plays no score
a play em <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1010280#taiko/2114848">Kageyama Shota - Sentou! Denshousha Higana (Muzukashii)</a> acabou subindo 11pp, sendo que era #9 melhor play, isso é muita coisa

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430201054173462548/760732733935845416/unknown.png">
Sentou! Denshousha Higana (Muzukashii) com dificuldade de 2.84*, atualmente tem 3.29*

eu ganhei pp e parece que a maioria perdeu bastante pp, por isso acabei subindo de 18k pra 10k
isso provavelmente é pq muita gente tinha plays de farm, e agora essas plays não valem nada
como por exemplo as plays em <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/928431#taiko/1939224">Nog - Aether Ritual (Ritual Oni)</a>

i played LoL again after one week? i think?
and i did some work today and yesterday on the college thingy, i'll search how to say it...
but... what i've found doesn't apply to what i'm doing with my team. we're doing an academic project for graduation in tecnology... it isn't a monograph or something like that...
i'll not mess my head up with this thing at 3 AM

edit: and i actually edited the css... so images aren't that large (like 1000px)
